# Rolling-Metrics
Rolling-Metrics is the monitoring library which provides advanced monitoring structures with rolling time window semantic.

## Supported monitoring primitives
* Rolling time window counters. [See documentation for counters](doc-pages/counters.md).
* Rolling time window hit-ratio. [See documentation for hit-ratio](doc-pages/hit-ratio.md).
* Ranking of queries by latency. [See documentation for ranking](doc-pages/ranking.md).
* Loss-less capturing histograms(based on HdrHistogram). [See documentation for histograms](doc-pages/histograms.md).

## Integrations
The reasons why anybody can decide to to use ```Rolling-metrics``` together with anything else:
* Any monitoring metric needs to be reported and visualized. In same time, Rolling-Metrics does not provide any functionality related to monitoring data reporting,
because author has no time to reinvent the wheel. Instead, you are free to integrate ```Rolling-metrics``` as first class citizen to another monitoring technology(for example JMX)
and reuse already existed reporters and visualizers created for this technology.
* You already use another monitoring library, but it does not obeys to monitoring manifest(described below), as result you are unhappy by latency, contention, precision, unpredictable retention, or unnecessary garbage generation.
* You already use another monitoring library, but some functionality provided by Rolling-Metrics is missed in library which you already use.

```Rolling-metrics``` seamlessly integrated with following monitoring frameworks and standarts:
* [JMX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html). See documentation about JMX integration [there](doc-pages/integration/jmx.md).
* [Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics). See documentation about Eclipse MicroProfile integration [there](doc-pages/integration/eclipse-microprofile.md).
* [Dropwizard Metrics](http://metrics.dropwizard.io), both ```3.x``` and ```4.x``` brachnes. See documentation about Dropwizard Metrics integration [there](doc-pages/integration/jmx.md).
